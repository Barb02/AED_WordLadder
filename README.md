# AED_WordLadder

Project made for Data Structures and Algorithms subject at University

The program goal is to find the "word ladder" between two words given by the user. The solution uses the implementation of a hash table and a graph. 

Details about the proposed problem can be found in this [guide.](https://github.com/Barb02/AED_WordLadder/blob/main/guiaoWordLadder)
Report also avaible, [here.](https://github.com/Barb02/AED_WordLadder/blob/main/WordLadder.pdf)
